# ImageTransformProject
A colorful journey through C++ image processing. This project will edit the imported PNG image by illinifying, spotlighting, and watermarking it using C++ language.


## Part 1: HSLAPixel
## Understanding Color Spaces
we will not be working with the physical properties of color that you may be familiar with from
other sources (the “RGB color space” for red-green-blue channels.) Instead, we will be using an alternative
color space that represents colors by human perception of color. The HSL color space uses the Hue, Saturation,
and Luminance of the color. From the Adobe Technical Guides page on “The HSB/HLS Color Model”, Adobe
explores these terms:

## Hue
Hue (denoted as h) defines the color itself, for
example, red in distinction to blue or yellow. The
values for the hue axis run from 0–360° beginning
and ending with red and running through green,
blue and all intermediary colors like greenish-blue,
orange, purple, etc.
There are two main hues :

* "Illini Orange" has a hue of 11.
* "Illini Blue" has a hue of 216.
